Dockerized Project
==================

### ARCHIVED: This project is no longer maintained. We are developing now an environment "space-harbor" based on Kubernetes

Automated deployment of Dockerized environment from GIT which includes:

- systemd integration
- production specific .env configuration
- test server specific .env configuration (when: host equals localhost)
- Makefile support to manage the project
- Optionally: Encrypted .env-prod files in project repository, decrypted during deployment

Preliminaries
-------------

1. You need a project at any git server.
2. The project need to have a Makefile with task "deployment_pre"
3. Your project need to have an `.env` file, or `.env-template` that will be copied into `.env`

Environment
----------- 

```yamlex 
# user who deploys the application
deploy_user: tech.admin
deploy_group: technical
compose_env_name: "your-docker-compose-environment-name-there"
systemd_service_sleep: 30

project_dir: /project

# change it to sg. "./make.sh" if you have a root-executed entrypoint for given group of users
# do not use sudo here (avoid making sudo in sudo inception)
make_executable: "./make.sh"

# this origin will be set only during deployment time
git_deploy_url: https://user:password@somehost/someuser/somerepo

# without user and password, this form will stay on server
git_regular_deploy_url: https://somehost/someuser/somerepo

# prevents from restarting whole environment when deploying the project over and over again
avoid_whole_environment_restart: yes

#
# Recovery from backup, on first deployment you may want to restore whole environment from backup
# or in case of a failure. Generally this flag should be set manually per-deployment.
#
# Only if you have setup a File Repository instance on external server for backups storage.
#
restore_from_backup_with_recovery_plan: no

# prefer .env-prod (if present in cloned git repository) instead of .env-dist
prefer_env_prod_over_dist: yes

# .env support (also works with .env-prod)
test_specific_env:
    - { line: "DOMAIN_SUFFIX=.localhost", regexp: '^DOMAIN_SUFFIX', title: 'env: Add domain suffix - .localhost' }

production_specific_env:
    - { line: "DOMAIN_SUFFIX=", regexp: '^DOMAIN_SUFFIX', title: 'env: Remove domain suffix' }

```

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. Provisioning as user X, but running Riotkit's Harbor as user Y

It may be very confusing to the Makefile, who exactly should run non-privileged commands.
The solution is to skip user automatic detection, by hardcoding user and group id into the .env file

```yamlex
test_specific_env:
    - { line: "DOMAIN_SUFFIX=.localhost", regexp: '^DOMAIN_SUFFIX', title: 'env: Add domain suffix - .localhost' }
    - { line: "APP_USER=tech.admin", regexp: '^APP_USER', title: 'env: APP_USER' }
    - { line: "APP_GROUP_ID=1800", regexp: '^APP_GROUP_ID', title: 'env: APP_GROUP_ID' }

production_specific_env:
    - { line: "DOMAIN_SUFFIX=", regexp: '^DOMAIN_SUFFIX', title: 'env: Remove domain suffix' }
    - { line: "APP_USER=tech.admin", regexp: '^APP_USER', title: 'env: APP_USER' }
    - { line: "APP_GROUP_ID=1800", regexp: '^APP_GROUP_ID', title: 'env: APP_GROUP_ID' }

```
